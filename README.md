# CSharp_CRUD
Repository for CSharp CRUD Demo Item 08.

> This C# Windows Forms project implements a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
application for managing vehicle records using a SQL Server database. The program allows users to add, view,
update, and delete vehicle data, which includes details like make, model, year, price, and electric status.

> It also allows users to upload and display vehicle images. The vehicle records are displayed in a DataGridView, 
and database interactions are managed using ADO.NET with SqlConnection and SqlCommand. The project features error 
handling and user feedback through message boxes.
